                    Theme Tussle is a 2D fighting game made for true fighting game enthusiasts.
                    All characters in the game are stylized around movie themes.
                    The player controls a character they select and heads out to battle against other characters.
                    The matches will be put under a timer, and the idea is to lower your opponent's health bar to 0 to achieve victory.
                    If your health bar were to reach 0, you would lose. 
                    Different characters will be available for the player. 
                    This allows the player to maybe find a character that suits them.
                </p>

                    The main character is a girl from the West called Nina.
                    She’s a bounty hunter with a love for money and adventures.
                    She won’t hesitate to say what’s on her mind. 
                    Her playstyle is an in-your-face character with many weapons, such as a rope and her trusty pistol.
                    Her goal in this game is to catch her bounty, Charlie. 
                    Her playstyle will be very beginner friendly to act as a good first character to try out.

                    Suzie is a thief who dreams of robbing someone of high authority, claiming their riches as her own.
                    She is a quick and stealthy character who attacks with a dagger and ninja stars.
                    Her health bar is much smaller than that of other characters, but don’t let that fool you her speed makes up for it.

                    Leo, King of Spiders, is a huge man who commands spiders to attack his opponents. 
                    He wants to get rid of anyone who opposes him. His size makes him easier to hit, but his bigger health bar and ability to throw out loyal spiders makes him a scary opponent.
                    
                    Charlie is a rogue jester who dislikes responsibilities and wants to spread smiles and laughs worldwide.
                    Unfortunately, her methods are poorly thought out, as they hurt people more than help. 
                    Their playstyle is unpredictable as they can throw an assortment of random objects that all fulfill different tasks.
